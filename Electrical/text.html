	<p>The OpAmp is a simple nonideal model with a smooth out.v = f(vin) characteristic, where &quot;vin = in_p.v - in_n.v&quot;. The characteristic is limited by VMax.v and VMin.v. Its slope at vin=0 is the parameter Slope, which must be positive. (Therefore, the absolute value of Slope is taken into calculation.)</p>
